# PrivacySpy Bot

**NOTE:** This project is actively being rewriten. See the [`go-rewrite` branch](https://github.com/doamatto/ps-crawl/tree/go-rewrite) for more information.

## Usage
Using this bot is incredibly easy. After building it (see next section or click [here](#building)), you can run the bot by doing:
```sh
$ ./bin/spy --github-token=<github-token>
```

You can get a GitHub (Personal) token [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens). Ensure that you give your token the `public_repo` scope, so that it can make issues. This bot is made on purpose not to be too expandable, as there is little to no need. See [the future ideas](#future-ideas) for any ideas in the future of how this may change. You can use `-v` or `--verbose` to enable verbose logging to make it easy to debug either the bot or PrivacySpy.

## Building
1. Install [Dart](https://dart.dev)
2. Fetch dependencies (`dart pub get`)

To build binaries, use `dart compile exe bin/spy.dart`. Regardless of platform, the `exe` parameter will compile a binary for your OS (Linux, macOS, Windows, et al).

## Future ideas
- [X] ~~Typings for expected responses to allow both null-safety and piece of mind~~ (It's partial but it's safe by nature due to Dart)
- [X] ~~Disable push to GitHub to show just problems (CI mode, if you will)~~
- [ ] Ensure rendering of hydrated content works fine
  - [ ] JSP pages like [Mailfence](https://mailfence.com/en/privacy.jsp)
- [X] ~~Ensure weird text (that one apostrophe that is an apostrophe but isn't (`(?:")|(?:”)|(?:“)|(?:‟)`)) doesn't break things~~
- [X] Add handling for more seperations
- [ ] Fix Markdown links ([#121 of test repo](https://github.com/doamatto/privacyspy/issues/121))
  - [ ] Fix HTML links ([#176 of test repo](https://github.com/doamatto/privacyspy/issues/176))
